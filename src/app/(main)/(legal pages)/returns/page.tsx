      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">2. Refund Process</h2>
      <p>
        Once we receive and inspect your returned product, a refund will be processed to your
        original payment method within 7 working days. Refund timelines may vary depending on your
        bank or payment provider.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">3. Exchanges</h2>
      <p>
        Exchanges are offered for size changes or product defects (subject to availability). If an
